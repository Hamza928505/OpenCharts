/**
 * a11y.js — the part of a chart somebody can use without seeing it.
 *
 * Every chart here draws to a canvas or an SVG, and both are opaque to a
 * screen reader: a `<canvas>` is a rectangle of pixels with nothing inside it
 * to read, and an SVG full of `<path>` elements is barely better. Until now
 * the studio exported charts that were, to a blind reader, a blank box — and
 * it exported them into other people's sites, which makes it a defect in the
 * product's own output rather than a missing nicety.
 *
 * The fix is the one Highcharts settled on and the one this codebase was
 * already holding the pieces for: **give the chart a text description and put
 * the real numbers in a table.** Keyboard-navigating individual data points is
 * the other half of what Highcharts does, and it is not attempted here — a
 * canvas has no per-point DOM to focus, and building a parallel one for 114
 * charts would be a second renderer to keep in step. A table is the honest
 * answer for a library this shape, and it is the fallback Highcharts itself
 * offers.
 *
 * **Nothing here is written per chart.** The description is assembled from
 * `title`, `blurb`, the `read` line in `chart-help.js` and the shape of the
 * data; the table is `def.toText(spec)`, which the suite already holds to a
 * round trip. A chart that gains a good `toText` gains a good table for free,
 * and one with a broken `toText` shows up here before it shows up anywhere
 * else — the same bargain the AI prompt makes.
