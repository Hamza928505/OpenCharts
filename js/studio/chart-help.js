/**
 * chart-help.js — how to read each chart, and what it hides.
 *
 * `blurb` says what a chart is for; this says how to actually read one, which
 * is a different and more useful thing. Each entry has:
 *
 *   read   what the marks encode — position, length, angle, area, colour
 *   watch  the misreading this chart invites, stated plainly
 *
 * Every chart type has a characteristic way of misleading people. Saying so
 * is more honest than pretending the choice is neutral, and it is the part
 * most chart libraries leave out.
 *
 * A category-level fallback covers anything without its own entry, so this
 * table can grow without leaving gaps.
