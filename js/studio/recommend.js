/**
 * recommend.js — which of these charts is a *good* idea, and why.
 *
 * **This deliberately reverses a rule stated elsewhere in this codebase.**
 * `DataMatch.js` says, and still says of itself:
 *
 *   > Nothing here decides whether a chart is a good way to show the data. It
 *   > decides whether the chart can read it, which is a question with an
 *   > answer. Ranking beyond that would be an opinion dressed as a result.
 *
 * That rule is right about `DataMatch` and wrong as a rule for the product. A
 * reader holding a spreadsheet is told "98 of 115 charts can read this", which
 * is true and almost useless: it is a list of everything, ordered by category.
 * The question they came with is which *one* to draw.
 *
 * So an opinion is offered — but never dressed as a result:
 *
 * - **Every suggestion states its reason**, in terms of the reader's own
 *   columns. "4 categories and one measure — a bar compares them directly."
 *   A score with no sentence is exactly the thing the old rule was protecting
 *   against, and none is shown.
 * - **The caution comes from `chart-help.js`**, which already names how each
 *   chart type misleads. A recommendation that cannot say what is wrong with
 *   its own suggestion is advertising.
 * - **It is advisory and cannot narrow anything.** `rankCharts` still decides
 *   what is *possible*; this only orders and explains. Nothing is hidden.
 * - **Nothing is invented.** A rule fires only when the profile actually
 *   supports it, and where no rule fires the reader is told that rather than
 *   handed a confident guess.
