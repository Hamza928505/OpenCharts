/**
 * prompt.js — the copy-and-paste brief that turns somebody's spreadsheet into
 * this exact chart.
 *
 * The studio already answers "how do I build this chart?" for a reader willing
 * to edit code. This answers it for a reader who would rather hand the job,
 * and their own file, to an assistant. It is the same three facts the studio
 * is built on, written out as prose an AI can follow:
 *
 *   what the chart is        title, blurb, and how it misleads
 *   what table it reads      the columns, their roles, and a worked example
 *   what code draws it       the Standalone export, already working
 *
 * Every part is derived, never hand-maintained. The column list comes from the
 * schema's own `example`, the roles from that example's first row of data, and
 * the template from the same `generateCode` the code tabs show — so a prompt
 * cannot describe a format the chart does not read, or ship code the studio
 * would not have produced.
 *
 * It asks for two outputs on purpose. The CSV is the way back into the studio
 * — paste it into the data editor and keep editing; the page is the way out of
 * it. Offering only the code would make the platform a dead end.
 *
 * Two modes, because there are two questions:
 *
 *   full   format + working code. The assistant returns a page that runs.
 *   data   format only. The assistant returns a table to paste into the editor.
 *
 * `data` exists because the template is roughly 70% of the message, and when
 * all somebody wants is their spreadsheet reshaped, every byte of it is
 * overhead. It is not the default: without the code an assistant writes the
 * chart from its own memory of Chart.js or D3, which renders *a* chart rather
 * than this one — the options, the palette and the helpers all drift.
 *
 * Dropping the code would not shorten the message by dropping *data*, either.
 * The template is mostly drawing code: a flow map is 13.5KB of JavaScript
 * carrying 0.8KB of data, and the rest is the projection and geo helpers no
 * assistant reconstructs from memory. That is the part worth sending.
