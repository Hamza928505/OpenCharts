/**
 * tooltip.js — hover readouts for the charts that draw themselves.
 *
 * Chart.js brings its own tooltips, so the 39 charts on that renderer were the
 * only ones you could interrogate. The other 59 drew a picture and told you
 * nothing: a bar was a bar, and the number behind it was unreachable. These two
 * helpers close that gap, one for each way the library draws.
 *
 * **Both functions are serialised verbatim into exported code**, so neither may
 * reference anything outside its own body — no imports, no module constants, no
 * shared style object. That is why the CSS is inline and repeated, and why the
 * two `readout()` builders below are twins rather than one helper. See "One
 * build function, two outputs" in CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * **One rule holds both of them together: the readout is rebuilt, never
 * remembered.** It is a child of the chart's host, and the host is emptied by
 * `renderChart` before every render and by a D3 or DOM `mount` on every redraw.
 * A flag saying "already attached" survives that; the node it was attached
 * about does not.

/**
 * Hover readouts for an SVG chart.
 *
 * Delegated from the host rather than bound per mark: a chart with 12,000 city
 * dots would otherwise pay for 12,000 listeners, and marks are rebuilt on every
 * redraw. A mark opts in by carrying `data-tip`.
 *
 * **The readout and the listener have different lifetimes, and must not share
 * one guard.** The listener is bound to the host, which outlives every redraw.
 * The readout is a *child* of the host — and a D3 or DOM mount empties its host
 * on every redraw, as does `renderChart` before every render. Behind a single
 * `__ocTips` flag that left a live handler writing into a node that had been
 * thrown away: hover worked on first paint and was dead from the first control
 * edit onward, on every self-drawn chart in the library. So the node is asked
 * for by `readout()`, which rebuilds it whenever it is no longer there, and
 * only the binding is guarded.
 *
 * @param {HTMLElement} host the element the chart was mounted into
